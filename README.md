 The Purpose of our App is to get people in the Georgia Community, a   
 place to gather, organize and educate with the mision of staying active    
 in the fight of the current law passed by Geogia Legislative.      
 This unlawful law is aimed to disenfranchise and make it harder    
 for African American and minorities to vote.      

 As a community we must Unify and Unite to this unjust law.
